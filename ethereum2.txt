 - they can be inactive (don’t run as an       │ - there will be one block proposer per slot
   actual validator yet), active (validating), │   for the beacon chain and one proposer
   pending (opted into becoming a validator    │   per slot for each of the shards
   but stuck in the entry queue) and exiting
   (no longer want to validate and stuck in
   the exit queue)

- VALIDATOR DEPOSIT CONTRACT
  - smart contract on the POW chain
    (in our case, the Ethereum Mainnet)
  - once ETH1 funds are locked in this
    smart contract, and event log is emitted
    that should be read by the beacon chain
    and the same amount of ETH2 should be
    allocated to the account, now considered
    a validator
  - this mechanism might change in the future
  - until phase 2 ends the transfer of ETH1
    to ETH2 is a one way street, can’t get
    ETH1 back, but there is an escape hatch
    to sell your stake once transfers
    between validators become possible

## Casper PoS Consensus [[{scalability.consensus.ethereum2,doc_has.comparative]]
- PoS stands for Proof-of-Stake.
@[https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-ethereum-2/]
- Reducing mining hardware requirements and scalates TX/s.
- Consensus continues to have eventual transaction finality.
  (mined transactions can appear and dissapear and we need to wait
  for N blocks to have statistical confirmation).

-  PoW             PoS
   miners       →  validators
   electricity  →  stake

"MINING":
 validator → deposit SC : commit 32 ETH as "skin in the game"
             ^1           into the official deposit contract
 ...
 network → network      : randomnly select new validator
                          to propose and attest to blocks
 validator → network    : correctly propose and attest to blocks
 network → validator    : reward

 ^1  Ethereum Foundation Eth2 deposit contract:
     https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/tree/dev/deposit_contract

- if a validator fails to stay online and execute their share of
  computational responsibilities, block reward will moderately decrease
  as to incentivize validators to stay online.

 - Byzantine validators trying to compromise the network
   (i.e. validate incorrect data history), will be punished
   with some/all of their 32 staked ETH.

 - In order for the beacon chain to launch its genesis block,
   at least 524,288 ETH must be staked on the network, divided
   among a minimum of 16,384 validators (these numbers were decided
   upon to ensure sufficient security and decentralization).
 - Staking rewards will not be distributed until this threshold
   is reached, which is partially why some altruistic behavior is
   needed among the early participants in phase 0.

   WARN: beacon chain will not be particularly useful to the majority
         of Ethereum users in  Phase 0 ;
         - it will be unable to process transactions, execute smart
           contracts, or host dapps.
           This is by design , ensuring Proof of Stake undergoes
           considerable testing as a live, functioning network before
           dapps and users begin transacting by the millions on a
           daily basis.

  Phase 0:
  - Original Ethereum 1.0 blockchain will continue to run
    in parallel and receive upgrades during Phase 0.

  Phase 1:
  - Implementation of shard chains.
  - Ethereum will be partitioned into 64 separate (shard) chains,
    coordinated by a beacon chain.

  Phase 1.5:
  - merging of the original PoW Ethereum with PoS chain.
    It will be brought into Ethereum 2.0 and exist as one
    of the 64 shard chains alongside the beacon chain
    with no break in continuity or data history.
    - ETH holders will not have to undergo any sort of
      token transfer or swap between Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0.

  Phase 2:
  - currently (2020-05) less defined.
    Enable ether accounts, transactions, transfers and withdrawals,
    and smart contract execution.
