### Onchain Permissioning (deprecated)

* Deprecated as inidicated in <https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts>.
  Las Update 2020-03-20.
* External Refs:

- SCs used to store and administer allowed nodes, accounts and admin whitelists.
  (vs whitelists in config files with the potential to have errors or not being in sync).

- Custom SCs and DApps can be implemented to work with onchain permissioning.

- Existing Permissioning contracts:
  - INGRESS CONTRACTS : proxy contracts DEFINED IN THE GENESIS FILE to defer the
    for nodes and       permissioning logic to the Node Rules and Account Rules contracts.
    accounts            The Ingress contracts deploy to static addresses.
  - NODE RULES        : stores node whitelist and node whitelist operations
                        (for example, add and remove).
  - ACCOUNT RULES     : stores the accounts whitelist and account
                        whitelist operations (for example, add and remove).
  - ADMIN             : stores the list of admin accounts and admin list
                        operations (for example, add and remove). There is one
                        list of admin accounts for node and accounts.

- Permissioning Management Dapp:
  - provides view and maintain access to the whitelists.

- Whitelists implemented:
  - ACCOUNTS that can submit transactions to the network.
  - NODES    that can join the network.
             TIP: All bootnodes must be on the nodes whitelist.
  - ADMINS   accounts that are able to update the ACCOUNTS
             and NODES WHITELISTS

  WARN: On-chain ACCOUNT whitelist permissioning is incompatible  [[{privacy}]]
        with random key signing for privacy marker transactions:
        A signing key must be specified using the
        "--privacy-marker-transaction-signing-key-file" cli flag,
        and also included in the accounts whitelist.
