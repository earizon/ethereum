   The Deposit Smart Contract (DSC) is an instrumental component of the
  Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 infrastructure. We have developed the first
  machine-checkable version of the incremental Merkle tree algorithm
  used in the DSC. We present our new and original correctness proof of
  the algorithm along with the Dafny machine-checkable version. The
  main results are: 1) a new proof of total correctness; 2) a software
  artefact with the proof in the form of the complete Dafny code base
  and 3) new provably correct optimisations of the algorithm.

  application can be built. Creators and rights holders register works 
  and their stakes in those works in smart contracts on the blockchain. 
  Payments are delivered automatically and instantly based on that 
  information using the self-enforcing smart contract technology. 
  Artists may also publish policies for how their music may be used, 
  facilitating an open marketplace in which anybody can innovate a new 
  business model, app or service as long as they meet the terms of 
  those policies.
