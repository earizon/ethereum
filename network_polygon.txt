# polygon.Network [[{scalability.layer2.polygon,layer2.rollup.optimistic,01_PM.TODO]]
- Layer 2 network with low transaction costs.
- Scanner: @[https://polygonscan.com/]
- Polygon solves pain points associated with Blockchains, like high gas
  fees and slow speeds, without sacrificing on security. This
  multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos,
  Avalanche etc, but with at least three major upsides:

  + It is able to fully benefit from Ethereum’s network effects
  + It is inherently more secure
  + It is more open and powerful

- Polygon is both a protocol and a framework for building and connecting
  Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, featuring:

  + One-click deployment of preset blockchain networks
  + Growing set of modules for developing custom networks
  + Interoperability protocol for exchanging arbitrary messages with Ethereum
    and other blockchain networks
  + Modular and optional "security as a service".
  + Adaptor modules for enabling interoperability for existing blockchain networks.

- TODO: Looks like different Polygon networks can connect
        through side-chains or rollups.
