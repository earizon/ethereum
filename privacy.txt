# Privacy [[{]]
## Privacy layers [[{standards.eea,privacy.101]]
└ PRIVACY OF PARTICIPANTS:
  Allow for anonymous parties.
  - on-chain cryptographic mechanisms
    like ring signatures, stealth addresses, mixing,
    or storage of private data off-chain.
└ PRIVACY OF DATA:
  keep transactions, balances, SCs, data encrypted
  on|off-chain, using cryptographic tools like ZKP
  and zk-SNARKS, Pedersen commitments, or off-chain
  privacy layers like TEEs.
  └ Consensys PROJECT UBIN:
    - Public TX validated by the whole network but whose amount,
      asset type,... are shielded.
      "...a consortium of financial institutions used
        zero-knowledge proofs to enable the transfer of digital assets on a
        distributed ledger without revealing information about the balances
        or TX amounts"
    - Project Khokha (South African Reserve Bank "PoC")
      Pedersen commitments are also additively homomorphic, which means that
      for a balance update, network participants can validate that the correct
      update has happened without knowing the opening balance, the closing
      balance, or the transfer amount:
      [[{02_doc_has.comparative]]
      Pedersen commitments and Folklore range proofs to process the typical
      daily volume of payments for the SARB with full confidentiality and
      finality in less than two hours. These commitment schemes proved to be
      much quicker to validate than the zero-knowledge proofs.
    - Adhara has been exploring substituting range proofs with bullet proofs,
      which are much smaller and quicker to validate. Very simply, instead
      of writing the balances and the transaction amounts in the clear as in
      a normal ERC20 contract, nodes write a proof or a Pedersen commitment
      of the balance.

└ Public-First + Privacy Layers = Future-Proof
  - Business networks need resilience, interoperability, permissioning,
    and privacy to succeed.

"...These requirements, however, are out of scope for proprietary distributed
ledgers, let alone traditional database technologies. The Ethereum
granular privacy layers and public-first approach make it a powerful
enterprise solution for organizations that need the flexibility of an in-
house platform and that want the global reach to participate in economies of
scale.
